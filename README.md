# 📧 Phishing Email Analysis Toolkit 🔍

A comprehensive, modular framework designed for systematic analysis of phishing emails. This toolkit facilitates multi-dimensional examination of phishing samples to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), suspicious behaviors, and tactics used by threat actors.


## 🚀 Overview

Phishing remains one of the most prevalent and effective cyberattack vectors, leveraging social engineering to deceive users into divulging sensitive information or executing malicious actions. This toolkit empowers security analysts and researchers to dissect phishing emails thoroughly by focusing on critical aspects such as:

- ✉️ **Sender and Header Forensics:** Validating authenticity and tracing origin.
- 🔗 **URL Extraction and Link Analysis:** Identifying malicious redirects, domain spoofing, and suspicious payload delivery.
- 📎 **Attachment Examination:** Detecting embedded malware or harmful payloads.
- 📝 **Linguistic and Style Analysis:** Spotting social engineering cues via language inconsistencies and grammatical anomalies.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **URL Mismatch Checks:** Comparing display URLs against actual targets to reveal obfuscation.
- 📊 **Comprehensive Summary:** Aggregating findings to support incident response and threat intelligence efforts.

The toolkit combines automated scripts with detailed markdown reports to ensure replicable, transparent analysis workflows.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🛠️ Automated Header Extraction and parsing.
- 🌐 URL Harvesting for all links within email content.
- 📂 Attachment Metadata Analysis.
- ✍️ Language Processing to detect anomalies.
- 🔍 URL Mismatch Detection to expose deceptive links.
- 📄 Extensible Markdown Reporting.
- 🖼️ Visual Aids with annotated screenshots.
